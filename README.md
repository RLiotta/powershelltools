The first one Razer killer is just to stop razers services from starting
if you want change any settings in synapse just turn them back on you shouldn't have to restart
So for service killer its just gonna turn off as much shit as possible for gaming performance
I can't guarantee but this lowers my startup processes to about 50~ 
this does not disable windows update or security center
many things will break edit the script as your liking ie.. 
if you use xbox services then remove them from the script before running


Service Slayer will be down until its running properly with menus and actually shutting serverices off
